## Dependency and Installation
Ubuntu 20.04
Python 3.8.5
Cuda version 11.0.3

1. Create Conda Environment

```shell
conda create --name pcpr python=3.8.5
conda activate pcpr
```

2. The requirements can be installed with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.7  # requires the other packages to be installed first
```

3. Please, download the MiT-B5 ImageNet weights provided by [SegFormer](https://github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer?tab=readme-ov-file#training)
from their [OneDrive](https://connecthkuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xieenze_connect_hku_hk/EvOn3l1WyM5JpnMQFSEO5b8B7vrHw9kDaJGII-3N9KNhrg?e=cpydzZ) and put them in the folder `pretrained/`.

## Training

```shell
python run_experiments.py --config configs/pcpr/gtaHR2csHR_pcpr.py
```

The logs and checkpoints are stored in `work_dirs/`.

## Inference
```shell
python -m tools.test ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} --show-dir ${SHOW_DIR}_HR --opacity 1 
```
